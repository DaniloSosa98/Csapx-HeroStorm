My week was extremely busy and everyhting accumulated, I wasn't able to think properly about this lab and I had time to work 
on it until wednesday at 8pm. Either way I wanted to finish it to learn properly and so you can see I was not being lazy, I just had
bad time management. Sorry for the inconvenience.
